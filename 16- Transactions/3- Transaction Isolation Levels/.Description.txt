Control the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other concurrent transactions. Different isolation levels define the degree to which transactions are isolated from each other.

Common Isolation Levels:
- READ UNCOMMITTED: Allows dirty reads, where one transaction can see uncommitted changes from another.
- READ COMMITTED: Prevents dirty reads, but non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can still occur.
- REPEATABLE READ: Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads.
- SERIALIZABLE: The highest isolation level, preventing dirty, non-repeatable, and phantom reads by fully isolating transactions.
