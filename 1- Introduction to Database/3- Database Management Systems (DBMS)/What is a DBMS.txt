A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that facilitates the creation, manipulation, and management of databases. It provides tools and interfaces for users to interact with and manage the data stored in a database.

>> Key Functions of a DBMS:

 1- Data Storage and Retrieval: Organizes and stores data efficiently, allowing users to quickly access and retrieve information.

 2- Data Manipulation: Supports operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data using languages like SQL.

 3- Data Security: Manages user permissions and access control to protect data from unauthorized access.

 4- Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data through constraints and validation rules.

 5- Transaction Management: Handles multiple database operations as a single unit of work, ensuring that transactions are completed fully or not at all (ACID properties).

 6- Backup and Recovery: Provides mechanisms for backing up data and recovering it in case of failure or loss.

>> Examples of DBMS:

 1- Relational DBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.

 2- Non-Relational DBMS: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j.
