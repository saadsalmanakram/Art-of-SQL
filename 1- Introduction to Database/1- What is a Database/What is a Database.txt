A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed electronically. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and organize data, allowing users to easily access and manipulate information. Databases are typically managed by a Database Management System (DBMS), which provides tools for creating, querying, updating, and deleting data. They are used in a variety of applications, from storing customer information in businesses to managing large datasets in scientific research.
