>> Relational Databases:

- Definition: Relational databases store data in structured tables with rows and columns. Each table represents an entity (like customers or orders), and relationships between tables are defined through keys (primary and foreign keys).

- Characteristics:
  1- Schema-Based: Data must adhere to a predefined schema or structure.
  2- SQL: Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and managing data.
  3- ACID Compliance: Ensures data integrity and consistency through Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability properties.

- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.

>> Non-Relational Databases:

- Definition: Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, store data in various formats that do not require a fixed schema. They are designed to handle a wide variety of data models and large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

- Characteristics:
  1- Flexible Schema: Data can be stored without a predefined schema or structure.
  2- Varied Data Models: Includes document stores, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases.
  3- Scalability: Often designed to scale out across many servers easily.

- Examples: MongoDB (document store), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (column-family store), Neo4j (graph database).
